> I had a citizen reach out to me recently to get a clearer view on my stance. I pointed him to my Facebook Page, and my blog post from my website I recently posted. At his request, below is a copy of what I said to him.
>
> I have [posted my opinion](https://www.facebook.com/taylor4pg/posts/1695821417388727) on the Road Fee the council suggested, and [on my website](https://taylor4pg.com/2017/07/14/road-fees-or-transportation-utility-fees/).
>
> Recognizing that a single council member cannot enact policy on his own, and that a plan cannot be solidly made until the vote on Prop 3 this November, this is a very difficult question to answer. I will do my best for you however.
>
> I do not believe that Prop 3 is the best option for our City for various reasons. I feel that a Road Fee, or Transportation Use/Utility Fee (whatever you would like to call it), is the most equitable and responsible way to address our current situation.
>
> I think there are some key areas that need to be considered with any solution that is put in place.
>
> 1. Economic Burden on the Citizenship - As a city we MUST be mindful of what we ask of the citizens. We are in an unfortunate circumstance where we as citizens must open our wallets to help the city, based on some past mistakes, but we cannot foot the entire bill as private citizens.
>
> 2. Time Frame - We need to address Roads in a reasonable time frame in line with the study that was done by the City. We also need to be aware of how long we require a road fee at the hands of private citizens.
>
> 3. Responsibility - We are a community in this city, and not simply a collection of households. Ripping 20% of the General Fund out to pay for roads, sounds on the surface like a fine solution. The reality however is that it is going to harm many more people than it will help. Jobs will be lost, services will suffer, and businesses and prospective homeowners will possibly turn aside and choose other towns.
>
> Above all, I want to help to heal the divisiveness in the City. Our diversity, and difference of opinion is what will help propel us to grow, and become great as a city. We need compassion, understanding, unity, and kindness to do this. As one man, I cannot make people act this way. However, I CAN advocate for these qualities, show them by example, and support the concepts of constructive opposition, and freedom in thought when it comes to our City Councils.
>
> I hope this helps you to see my stand on these issues more clearly.

> I have been advocating that we do some budgeting exercises, implement real, positive solutions, and do so immediately. The costs of kicking the can are getting too high. In fact, I have been urging my colleagues to consider the needs in essential infrastructure the entire time I have served over 38,000 residents of Pleasant Grove in elected office.
>
> My specific recommendations and proposals have included a number of compromises and efforts to heal and unite our city, like an often discussed "Scenario Seven." I generally point people to [VoteBen.com](http://VoteBen.com) to learn more, and encourage them to visit [this link](http://www.heraldextra.com/news/opinion/local-guest-opinions/guest-opinion-the-case-for-funding-roads/article_1393e467-51d6-5cc2-a0f7-89cb720ce221.html) to read some important perspectives.
>
> Video from Council Meetings on April 12, 2016, June 7, 2016, June 21, 2016, February 28, 2017, May 2, 2017, and April 11, 2017 highlight some of the important aspects of what has really been happening in our city and provide great detail on many of my very specific proposals to fix roads in a responsible way to align the priorities of the city with those of the citizens.
>
> We should be putting more of our new revenue every year toward roads, among the long list of other suggestions I have outlined in public meetings for years.

> Recently I heard from a few people asking me my position on fixing our roads and a timeline of resolutions.   I agree (along with most citizens of Pleasant Grove) that the roads are an issue.  However, I’d like to give you my perspective on why the roads are bad and how I would work to fix the roads if I were elected. The issue of the roads is not due to poor planning or even proper prioritization. It’s a matter of revenue into our sleepy little city. I’m not blaming past councils but about 10 years ago the city decided not to offer incentives and (as one developer I talked to recently) were too difficult to work with. During this time and up until recently, Pleasant Grove, Utah wasn’t willing to work with developers, restaurants, hotels, coffee shops, etc., so they simply went into neighboring towns.  I am a firm believer in helping draw businesses to Pleasant Grove.  Some organizations such as large draw destinations understand that they can approach City Councils and negotiate fair trade as they bring in other development opportunities for the city.  It’s how its done, its normal occurrence in the develop world and one that we must play.   If we don’t, we will simply continue to draw upon the citizens of Pleasant Grove for improvements, road maintenance, and city services.   We need seasoned professionals who have negotiated contracts, worked with business, and understand economic principles to lead our City Council.  I have that experience.
>
> I urge all citizens of Pleasant Grove to take a look at the overall budgets of American Fork, Lindon, Lehi, and Orem and you’ll be amazed at the difference.   (Happy to supply if requested)  The reason for the larger budgets is that they have welcomed, given incentives, and worked with outside organizations to bring revenue into the city.  I urge you to read or reread my blog on “Revenue solves most problems”.   I have already stated my public opposition on Proposition 3 as I believe it ties the hands of our elected officials to govern our city.  I know that everyone of the current City Council members are for fully funding the roads, but some of thier tactics differ on how to do that.
>
> I believe that we need to immediately implement a declining road fee (~$10/month) that can be reduced and eventually eliminated as commercial development increases. This is something that can be instituted immediately upon finalization of the election.  I’m a firm believer of smaller reduced governments and low taxation, but I also believe we have a moral, ethical, and visionary responsibility to keep our town on the forefront of productivity as to make a nice place for each of us to raise our families, increase our property values, and provide a community that we can all be proud of.

## Jeffrey Butler

> I drive a lot for my job. Some years I have put over 20,000 miles on my car traveling across the state from St. George to Logan, Tooele to Roosevelt and Pleasant Grove to Richfield. The past few years however, most of my time is spent driving in Salt Lake and Utah counties, so I have seen a lot of different roads and their maintenance or lack thereof. Where do the roads in Pleasant Grove rank based on my experience? Not at the top but definitely not at the bottom.
>
> The reason I share this is obvious to anyone living in Pleasant Grove right now. What are your thoughts about the roads, what is my plan, where do I stand on Proposition 3?
>
> Well, honeslty if I drive on the main roads between my home and Main Street or the freeway, the only road that has need for work is 1300 West (Proctor Lane) between State Street and Pleasant Grove Blvd. That could use some work and I'm sure those local residents would completely agree! But I do drive through most parts of the city and recognize there are many more roads that need be fixed than just Proctor Lane.
>
> I have read Proposition 3 and I have looked at the city's 3 year plan for road fix and maintenance. The intent to prioritize road maintenance is understandable, but the details and the requirements posed in prop 3 do not promote the welfare of our community. The maintenance plan over three years is detailed and makes sense, but I would like to better understand the reasoning behind some of the proposed projects versus others that I know could use work.
>
> Do we do a bond, do we have a road fee, do we increase property tax, do we allocate more to the roads, do we rely more on state funding, what about sales tax and business property tax revenue, does the city tighten the belt even more?
>
> All these have been discussed and should continue to be vetted as quickly as possible with reasoned and respectful dialogue. Accusations and conjecture do not promote dialogue, in fact it drives away many who don't want to deal with the drama, which really is a tragedy, because we need the input from all citizens, we need understanding, we need to be on the same page; even if we may not completely agree! We are in this together!
>
> Now, what would I do? I would reassess the maintenance plan, making sure the public knows what the city sees as priorities and why those are priorities versus other roads to seek more input or understanding. I would propose that if there is a road fee or property tax increase that it is within reason and designate those funds specifically to the roads. I would encourage more positive response from the city workers to road issues so that the citizens realize they are being heard. I want to continue to encourage business growth so that sales and property tax revenue can be used to help improve the city, its infrastructure and relieve the family tax burden.
>
> I welcome any thoughts and productive ideas!

>I'll try to keep it brief. 😉
>
><strong>Background: (yada yada yada part most know 😉):</strong>
>
>According the J.U.B. Study we need a min of $3.8M/ year to maintain the roads with fair improvements happening over the course of the next 20 years.
>
>We are currently receiving around $1.2M from the state in Class C roads funds. This year is the last bond payment on a bond taken out it 2008. So next year we will need at least $2.6M in additional funds to prevent them from falling farther behind.
>
>Proposition 3 asks for $2.625M be transferred from the general funds to a road fund to address that need.  While leaving the funding of current services open to/ or vacant of other funding options.
>
><strong>Political Banter (yada yada yada part most would rather skip):</strong>
>
>If elected I will have 4 years to start that process and wont be able to fix all of the roads. In that time I would like to have established a transparent plan that allows for the growth of services currently provided, minimally addressing roads, and does not overburden any one source in the process.  This is going to take compromise from all sides and bringing together the ideas of as many people as we can to get it to actually work in a way that everyone can feel proud and confident in the city again.
>
>Having a solid plan for transparency, reduced burden, and at least minimally funding roads as soon as possible should be produced by anyone running for office.
>
>Plan: (meat and potatoes)
>
>Increasing rec program fees, community center fees, and pool fees we can reduce the subsidies these services receive and increase the amount of general fund revenue for roads by around $160,000.
>
>By committing to utilize new revenue we can agree to increase general fund allocations yearly by $260,000 leaving room for raises and other projects as we continue to encourage responsible growth of our commercial sector
>
>Fund balance: we currently have just shy of $2.6M in our non-allocated general fund balance. using $780,000 in 2019, $520,000 in 2020, and 260,000 in 2021 we will use up $1.56M of our general fund balance.  This money is revenue that was not spent in previous years and can only be used for capitol improvement projects. We transferred over $450,000 of our fund balance last year into capitol improvements that we are spending this year on several small projects.
>
>Roads are a capitol improvement project and have the greatest need for funds in our city.
>
><strong>This will leave us with $1M/year still to fund.</strong>
>
>By doing a review of how each department would be effected by different levels of cuts we can decide what departments have room and what departments do not.
>
>We do a budget review of what a <strong>3%, 9%, and 18%</strong> cut would do to services provided.
>
>We do this also with a <strong>line item budget</strong> similar to what other cities in the valley have implemented in order to produce transparency.
>
>If the $1M shortfall can't be found in the budget, we produce 2 reports for the citizens. One outlining what cuts we where able to make and another outlining what further cuts would be made if they do not approve an increase. Then the decision will be left to the citizens as to what level of service they want from our city.
>
>Not minimally funding roads is not on option. With the rate of decay and the dramatic increase in cost, not minimally funding roads will only lead to the loss of more services or the increase of more taxes. The question should never have been how much more do you want to pay for roads.
