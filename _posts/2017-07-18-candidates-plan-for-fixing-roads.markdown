> I had a citizen reach out to me recently to get a clearer view on my stance. I pointed him to my Facebook Page, and my blog post from my website I recently posted. At his request, below is a copy of what I said to him.
>
> I have [posted my opinion](https://www.facebook.com/taylor4pg/posts/1695821417388727) on the Road Fee the council suggested, and [on my website](https://taylor4pg.com/2017/07/14/road-fees-or-transportation-utility-fees/).
>
> Recognizing that a single council member cannot enact policy on his own, and that a plan cannot be solidly made until the vote on Prop 3 this November, this is a very difficult question to answer. I will do my best for you however.
>
> I do not believe that Prop 3 is the best option for our City for various reasons. I feel that a Road Fee, or Transportation Use/Utility Fee (whatever you would like to call it), is the most equitable and responsible way to address our current situation.
>
> I think there are some key areas that need to be considered with any solution that is put in place.
>
> 1. Economic Burden on the Citizenship - As a city we MUST be mindful of what we ask of the citizens. We are in an unfortunate circumstance where we as citizens must open our wallets to help the city, based on some past mistakes, but we cannot foot the entire bill as private citizens.
>
> 2. Time Frame - We need to address Roads in a reasonable time frame in line with the study that was done by the City. We also need to be aware of how long we require a road fee at the hands of private citizens.
>
> 3. Responsibility - We are a community in this city, and not simply a collection of households. Ripping 20% of the General Fund out to pay for roads, sounds on the surface like a fine solution. The reality however is that it is going to harm many more people than it will help. Jobs will be lost, services will suffer, and businesses and prospective homeowners will possibly turn aside and choose other towns.
>
> Above all, I want to help to heal the divisiveness in the City. Our diversity, and difference of opinion is what will help propel us to grow, and become great as a city. We need compassion, understanding, unity, and kindness to do this. As one man, I cannot make people act this way. However, I CAN advocate for these qualities, show them by example, and support the concepts of constructive opposition, and freedom in thought when it comes to our City Councils.
>
> I hope this helps you to see my stand on these issues more clearly.

> I have been advocating that we do some budgeting exercises, implement real, positive solutions, and do so immediately. The costs of kicking the can are getting too high. In fact, I have been urging my colleagues to consider the needs in essential infrastructure the entire time I have served over 38,000 residents of Pleasant Grove in elected office.
> 
> My specific recommendations and proposals have included a number of compromises and efforts to heal and unite our city, like an often discussed "Scenario Seven." I generally point people to [VoteBen.com](http://VoteBen.com) to learn more, and encourage them to visit [this link](http://www.heraldextra.com/news/opinion/local-guest-opinions/guest-opinion-the-case-for-funding-roads/article_1393e467-51d6-5cc2-a0f7-89cb720ce221.html) to read some important perspectives.

> Video from Council Meetings on April 12, 2016, June 7, 2016, June 21, 2016, February 28, 2017, May 2, 2017, and April 11, 2017 highlight some of the important aspects of what has really been happening in our city and provide great detail on many of my very specific proposals to fix roads in a responsible way to align the priorities of the city with those of the citizens.
> 
> We should be putting more of our new revenue every year toward roads, among the long list of other suggestions I have outlined in public meetings for years.

> Recently I heard from a few people asking me my position on fixing our roads and a timeline of resolutions.   I agree (along with most citizens of Pleasant Grove) that the roads are an issue.  However, I’d like to give you my perspective on why the roads are bad and how I would work to fix the roads if I were elected. The issue of the roads is not due to poor planning or even proper prioritization. It’s a matter of revenue into our sleepy little city. I’m not blaming past councils but about 10 years ago the city decided not to offer incentives and (as one developer I talked to recently) were too difficult to work with. During this time and up until recently, Pleasant Grove, Utah wasn’t willing to work with developers, restaurants, hotels, coffee shops, etc., so they simply went into neighboring towns.  I am a firm believer in helping draw businesses to Pleasant Grove.  Some organizations such as large draw destinations understand that they can approach City Councils and negotiate fair trade as they bring in other development opportunities for the city.  It’s how its done, its normal occurrence in the develop world and one that we must play.   If we don’t, we will simply continue to draw upon the citizens of Pleasant Grove for improvements, road maintenance, and city services.   We need seasoned professionals who have negotiated contracts, worked with business, and understand economic principles to lead our City Council.  I have that experience.
> 
> I urge all citizens of Pleasant Grove to take a look at the overall budgets of American Fork, Lindon, Lehi, and Orem and you’ll be amazed at the difference.   (Happy to supply if requested)  The reason for the larger budgets is that they have welcomed, given incentives, and worked with outside organizations to bring revenue into the city.  I urge you to read or reread my blog on “Revenue solves most problems”.   I have already stated my public opposition on Proposition 3 as I believe it ties the hands of our elected officials to govern our city.  I know that everyone of the current City Council members are for fully funding the roads, but some of thier tactics differ on how to do that.
> 
> I believe that we need to immediately implement a declining road fee (~$10/month) that can be reduced and eventually eliminated as commercial development increases. This is something that can be instituted immediately upon finalization of the election.  I’m a firm believer of smaller reduced governments and low taxation, but I also believe we have a moral, ethical, and visionary responsibility to keep our town on the forefront of productivity as to make a nice place for each of us to raise our families, increase our property values, and provide a community that we can all be proud of.
